# SoloPilot Demo Client Repository

This repository serves as a testing ground for **SoloPilot**'s automated development workflow capabilities.

## Purpose

This repo demonstrates SoloPilot's end-to-end automation features:

- ✅ **Real-Time Code Generation** with immediate linting feedback
- ✅ **Automated SonarCloud Integration** with zero-touch project provisioning  
- ✅ **Multi-Language Linting** (Python: ruff, mypy, bandit | JavaScript: eslint)
- ✅ **AI Self-Correction** during code generation (up to 3 iterations)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Quality Analysis** combining static analysis + AI insights

## How It Works

1. **SoloPilot Dev Agent** generates code with real-time linting feedback
2. **Automated Push** to this repository via `scripts/push_artifacts.py`
3. **SonarCloud Auto-Provisioning** creates project `arkb75_solopilot-demo-client`
4. **Quality Analysis** runs automatically on all pushed code
5. **AI Reviewer** aggregates findings and posts comprehensive reviews

## Repository Structure

Generated projects will be organized as:

```
artifact/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── milestone-1/
│   ├── implementation.py
│   ├── test.py
│   └── README.md
├── milestone-2/
│   └── ...
├── unit_tests/
│   └── integration.test.js
└── manifest.json
```

## SonarCloud Integration

- **Project Key**: `arkb75_solopilot-demo-client`
- **Organization**: `solopilot-clients`
- **Automatic Analysis**: Triggered on every push
- **Quality Gate**: Configured for production-ready code standards

## Testing Instructions

To test SoloPilot with this repository:

```bash
# Generate a project with real-time linting
python scripts/run_solopilot.py "Create a Python CLI tool that fetches weather data"

# Push artifacts to this demo repo (auto-creates SonarCloud project)
python scripts/push_artifacts.py --repo https://github.com/arkb75/solopilot-demo-client.git

# View results
# - Code artifacts: GitHub branches
# - Quality analysis: SonarCloud dashboard
# - AI review: GitHub PR comments
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 🔍 Real-Time Linting
- **Python**: Ruff (style), MyPy (types), Bandit (security)
- **JavaScript**: ESLint (syntax, best practices)
- **Auto-Correction**: AI fixes linting errors during generation

### 🏭 Zero-Touch SonarCloud
- **Automatic Project Creation** via SonarCloud API
- **Git URL Parsing** for dynamic project naming
- **Webhook Configuration** for continuous analysis

### 🤖 AI-Powered Quality
- **Static Analysis Integration** (ruff, mypy, bandit, eslint)
- **SonarCloud Findings** (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells)
- **AI Insights** (architecture, best practices, improvements)
